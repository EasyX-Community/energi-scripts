# energi-scripts - Energi Masternode Scripts (Unofficial)

**- install-scripts -** Install and configure the scripts, asks for wallet<br />
**- energi3-unlock -** Unlocks wallet for staking, asks for password<br />
**- energi3-status -** Outputs status (blockheight, balance, staking, etc)<br />

These scripts are to help with starting, maintaining, and checking on the status of your NRG / Energi masternode.

I will add more scripts later if I can make more useful ones.
